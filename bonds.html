A bond is an IOU for a loan you’ve made to an institution like the government or a corporation. Similar to when you take out a car loan or a mortgage, when the government or a corporation borrows money from you they do so for a certain period of time at a certain rate of interest. <br>
Bonds are not like stocks. <br>When you purchase a bond you do not own part of the company that issued the bond. When you buy a bond you are lending money to the issuer, who can be a corporation, the government or a government agency. In return for the loan the issuer promises to pay you (the bond investor) a specific rate of interest known as the “coupon rate”. You are paid the interest on a predetermined schedule (usually quarterly) for the life of the bond. <br> The life of a bond refers to the period of time the issuer has to repay the investor. The issuer also promises to repay the face value when the bond matures (i.e., comes due). The face value is also known as “the principal” or the “par value.” Most bonds are issued with a $1000 face value.
